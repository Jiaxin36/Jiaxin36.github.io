I'm currently a master student in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://stat-ds.sustech.edu.cn/) at [SUSTech](https://stat-ds.sustech.edu.cn/). 

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Lili Yang](https://faculty.sustech.edu.cn/?tagid=yangll&iscss=1&snapid=1&orderby=date&go=2). My research interest includes urban computing, spatiotemporal data mining, transfer learning, and optimization.
